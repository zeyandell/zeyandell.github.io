::: {#intro-heading}
I am an urban sustainability professional and data analyst working for climate solutions on a local and regional level.

I believe that cities hold massive potential for addressing the climate crisis, as well as high levels of vulnerability, and that the coming era will demand flexibility, ingenuity, and dedication as we reimagine what city life can look like. With a background in environmental studies and data science, I am excited to join the next generation of urban sustainability leaders and find a path forward into the Anthropocene.

As a data scientist, I understand the importance of grounding sustainability initiatives in data of all different types. I am passionate about blending quantitative data with deep community engagement. Environmental harms and hazards affect real people in our cities, and we need all of our voices at the table to design solutions that help all of us.

Outside of work, you can find me juggling too many tabletop roleplaying games and foraging in local parks.
