Hi there! I'm Zoey. I'm an aspiring sustainability planner and data scientist working on local, data-driven solutions to the climate crisis. I love using my abilities as a researcher and "code detective" to dive deep into interesting environmental problems.

Outside of work, you can find me juggling too many ttrpg campaigns and foraging in local parks.
