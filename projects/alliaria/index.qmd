Garlic mustard, scientific name *Alliaria petiolata*, is a highly successful invasive plant in Minnesota. It grows in a biannual phase, with rosettes and adults growing in alternating years, and is a highly r-selected species. This modeling project, which is still ongoing, was undertaken as a research project at Macalester College in conjunction with field research on the success of garlic mustard and native species at Ordway Research Station.

This project was initially coded in MATLAB, then moved to C++ to accomodate large datasets, with visualizations done in Python.
