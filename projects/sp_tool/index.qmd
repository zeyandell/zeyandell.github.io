This [tool](https://metrocouncil.org/Communities/Planning/Local-Planning-Assistance/Greenhouse-Gas-Strategy-Planning-Tool.aspx) projects greenhouse gas emissions out to 2040 for municipalities in the Twin Cities metropolitan area and estimates the impact of greenhouse gas reduction strategies ranging from increasing transit-oriented development to improving energy efficiency. It was designed to assist local policymakers with climate planning and goal-setting.

This tool was designed by a team of researchers at the Metropolitan Council over the course of several years. I joined the team in 2023 and assisted with troubleshooting, fixed data errors, and wrote high-level documentation of our process for the "Methods" page. More details can be found in the tool itself, and in the github repository once it is publically available.
