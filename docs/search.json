    "text": "I am an urban sustainability professional and data analyst working for climate solutions on a local and regional level.\nI believe that cities hold massive potential for addressing the climate crisis, as well as high levels of vulnerability, and that the coming era will demand flexibility, ingenuity, and dedication as we reimagine what city life can look like. With a background in environmental studies and data science, I am excited to join the next generation of urban sustainability leaders and find a path forward into the Anthropocene.\nAs a data scientist, I understand the importance of grounding sustainability initiatives in data of all different types. I am passionate about blending quantitative data with deep community engagement. Environmental harms and hazards affect real people in our cities, and we need all of our voices at the table to design solutions that help all of us.\nOutside of work, you can find me juggling too many tabletop roleplaying games and foraging in local parks."

    "text": "The Water series is a set of two brief compositions for the piano, written and played by me, exploring my associations with water throughout my life. Water I: Snowmelt draws on the feeling of early spring, when snow melts and runs in rivulets down steep inclines, inspired by visualizations of watershed flow and my own memories of springtime. When I listen to it, I think of the minnows darting around my feet during summer trips to Madeline Island, or of the sunlight glinting off melting snowdrifts in my backyard.\nWater II: Sunrise invokes the water of a lake as the sun rising over it paints it in a thousand different colors, reshaping the landscape with each passing moment. This piece was inspired by kayaking and canoeing with my family on lakes Mendota and Monona, and the still moments when we would lay our paddles down and just sit looking across the water, overtaken by the scale and beauty of it."

In response, my team drew on pilot programs from Wisconsin and existing Minnesota legislation to create the Agricultural Water Preservation Act, an act designed to support farmers in strategically planning to reduce fertilizer runoff, erosion and water table depletion. We were honored with third place in the competition for our attention to detail and strategic consideration.\nThe team consisted of (from left) Stellah Marienthal-LeGendre, myself, Cecilia Gomez Jimenez, and Maggie Wang."

    "section": "Policy Memo",
    "text": "Policy Memo\n\nMac GPT: Generating the Policy for TomorrowTeam 9: Farmer’s Assurance Minnesota’s Agricultural Water Preservation ActDEVELOPMENT OF A WATER PROTECTION PLAN (WWP)Under this policy, farmers in the state of Minnesota will be required to create and report a Water Protection Plan (WPP) analyzing their irrigation, nutrient management, and conservation strategies. The policy does not require compliance with any specific standards, but hopes to incentivize a shift to more sustainable behavior based on education and data availability. Farmers are responsible for reporting plans to their local county officials, who will be enforcing compliance in conjunction with the state. Resources will be made available through partnerships with state Extension agencies and local governments to incentivize farmers to adjust farming practices so that they are cost-effective and help decrease water consumption and contamination. More efficient irrigation and fertilizer plans will reduce costs to farmers.MORE THAN 70% OF NITRATE POLLUTION COMES FROM FERTILIZERSBased on the data from Minnesota Center of Environmental Advocacy, 40% of lakes, rivers and streams are polluted, and the number is growing. More than 70% of nitrate pollutants, a major pollutant in Minnesota waters, come from cropland. Agricultural runoff plays an important role in state water quality. This not only affects the clean water that people can access, but it further negatively influences the whole ecosystem in the state, the food system, and even people’s health conditions. To ensure the state citizens’ health and also reach the Sustainable Development Goals from the United Nations for global people, the state must help solve this water quality issue. MONITORING OF IRRIGATION TECHNOLOGYPart (1) of the WPP requires a plan for irrigation and water management, including data and estimates for water use. This section includes an analysis of currently used irrigation technologies to prompt reflection on the most efficient water use strategy given soil, plant needs, and growing conditions. Water use projections for a non-drought scenario should be in line with current Minnesota regulations on aquifer use.ADOPTION OF A NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT PLANPart (2) of the WPP requires a Nutrient Management Plan similar to the Clean Water Act for Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs). The requirement of Nutrient Management Plans, even without associated pollution reduction requirements, has been proven to decrease short-term nutrient pollution in Wisconsin, a state with a similar agricultural and ecological system to Minnesota. A Nutrient Management Plan will include yield goals, regular soil testing, nutrient input projections, and compliance with nutrient limits according to state and federal laws. For reference, see WI guidelines on the creation of Nutrient Management Plans.MITIGATION OF RUNOFF WATERPart (3) of the WPP provides farmers with resources to implement additional conservation strategies that may mitigate pollution runoff, including the addition of a forested “buffer zone” or a prairie strip to filter water and reduce runoff. While these practices are optional within this policy, farmers have the opportunity to access resources about the benefits of conservation strategies and funding to help implement them if so desired.THE WWP REDUCES COSTS FOR FARMERS AND FOR THE STATEWe anticipate that by reducing the amount of runoff water, ecosystems in the State of Minnesota will thrive since there will be a reduction in nutrient-rich pesticides entering water systems. This benefits communities that heavily rely on water, such as Indigenous communities that use water systems to grow wild rice. By reducing the amount of pesticides in the water by addressing the source, the state will spend less funds on water purification. Additionally, using estimates taken from past implemented policies, we project that farmers will save money by reducing costly inputs, such as fertilizer and chemical pesticides."

    "text": "The 2024 Met Council Greenhouse Gas Inventory was conducted as part of an EPA Climate Pollution Reduction Grant awarded to the Council. The first step in this ongoing process was to inventory greenhouse gas emissions from energy, transportation, and waste sectors for the 11-county grant region. The Priority Climate Action Plan, published in March 2024, includes a detailed report of this inventory’s results and suggested priority actions for reducing emissions in the included region.\nAs a part of the data team for this project, I developed the solid waste sector of this inventory, from sourcing data to conducting quality analysis of the results. I also wrote the solid waste chapters of a more detailed report that will be publicly available on Github shortly. The project was led by Joel Huting, Peter Wilfahrt, and LisaBeth Barajas."

Through extensive primary research, I traced the ways that parks were designed to give a tightly controlled impression of “nature” and thus relegate urbanites’ relationship with nature to a few specific areas within the cities. This paper builds on and localizes an ongoing discussion about parks design movements and perceptions of nature in cities.\nRead the paper here."
